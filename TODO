Rename `install.sh' and `libtool' in bin to balsa-install.sh and balsa-libtool.  Check that libtool
	will use that name.
Check all suggested buffer insertions

balsa
	balsa-c
	breeze-sim
		breeze-sim-debug
		breeze-sim-early
		breeze-sim-fast
	breeze-sim-ctrl
	breeze-cost
	breeze-opt
	breeze2ps

balsa-c
	Include cocktail generated source in balsa package to remove cocktail from dependency list

balsa-mgr/balsa-make-makefile/Project files
	Consolidate
	Lots of gtk2, code clean up related bugs
	Adding test fixtures to implementations doesn't work
		Can't edit top-level procedure name
		Breeze file name for test must be the same as Verilog file.  Add option to balsa-make-impl-test

breeze-cost
	Add as a balsa-netlist option or have a breeze-manipulate script to do Breeze level stuff

balsa-netlist
	Remove lots of options
	Have things like the buffer insertion done with a set of pluggable netlist-modifying modules
		(do simulation initialisation with something similar?)
	(and other backend tools) Deprecate BALSATECH, have -X/--technology command line option

breeze-sim
	Generate VCD as well as HHH

Balsasim library
	Audit for component-name-specific stuff

Technologies
	balsa-tech-amulet
	balsa-tech-example
	balsa-tech-minimal
	balsa-tech-umc130f
	balsa-tech-xilinx

Components
	Make it possible to add components more easily: audit explicit component references
	Think about having (primitive-component instead of $Brz
	Rationalise with sync == 0 bits
	Component specifying notation (autogenerate breeze-sim)

balsa-c/Balsa:
	halt inside conditional in loop fails to insert loop
	Add character escapes to Balsa/balsa-c
	Allow slicing of LHSs
	Slicing of LHSs causes segfault
	conditional expressions in Balsa?
	elseif, andalso and orelse in Balsa?

balsa-mgr:
	Changing tech style options doesn't work
	Can't edit balsa-netlist options
	Single assignment into a variable at startup should be good enough to turn
		that variable into a constant.  Better range checking (explicit?) on array accesses

Sort out operator applicability, xor/ /= thing

breeze-sim:
	breeze-sim doesn't recognise implicants in constants
